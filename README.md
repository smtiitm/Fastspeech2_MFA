# Fastspeech2 Model using MFA

This repository contains a Fastspeech2 Model for 8 Indian languages (male and female both) implemented using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) for speech synthesis. The model is capable of generating mel-spectrograms from text inputs and can be used to synthesize speech.

The Repo is large in size: We have used [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) due to Github's size constraint (please install latest git LFS from the link, we have provided the current one below).
```
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.python.sh | bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

Language model files are uploaded using git LFS. so please use:

```
git lfs fetch --all
git lfs pull
```
to get the original files in your directory. 

## Model Files

The model for each language includes the following files:

- `config.yaml`: Configuration file for the Fastspeech2 Model.
- `energy_stats.npz`: Energy statistics for normalization during synthesis.
- `feats_stats.npz`: Features statistics for normalization during synthesis.
- `feats_type`: Features type information.
- `pitch_stats.npz`: Pitch statistics for normalization during synthesis.
- `model.pth`: Pre-trained Fastspeech2 model weights.

## Installation

1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) first. Create a conda environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

2.Activate the conda environment (check inside environment.yaml file):
```shell
conda activate tts-mfa-hifigan
```

3.  Install PyTorch separately (you can install the specific version based on your requirements):
```shell
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit
pip install torchaudio
```
## Vocoder
For generating WAV files from mel-spectrograms, you can use a vocoder of your choice. One popular option is the [HIFIGAN](https://github.com/jik876/hifi-gan) vocoder (Clone this repo and put it in the current working directory). Please refer to the documentation of the vocoder you choose for installation and usage instructions. 

(We have used the HIFIGAN vocoder and have provided Vocoder tuned on Aryan and Dravidian languages)

## Usage

The directory paths are Relative. (Make changes to **text_preprocess_for_inference.py** and **inference.py** file. Update folder/file paths wherever required.)

**Please give language starting with capital letter and gender in small case and sample text between quotes. Output argument is optional; the provided name will be used for the output file.** 

Use the inference file to synthesize speech from text inputs:
```shell
python inference.py --sample_text "Your input text here" --language <language> --gender <gender> --output_file <file_name.wav OR path/to/file_name.wav>
```

**Example:**

```
python inference.py --sample_text "श्रीलंका और पाकिस्तान में खेला जा रहा एशिया कप अब तक का सबसे विवादित टूर्नामेंट होता जा रहा है।" --language hindi --gender male --output_file male_hindi_output.wav
```
The file will be stored as `male_hindi_output.wav` and will be inside current working directory. If **--output_file** argument is not given it will be stored as `<language>_<gender>_output.wav` in the current working directory.
